Frozen contract for issue #172, based on the approved proposal
`docs/issue-172/proposals/flows-json.md` §2-§3. This document is the
data-contract reference for the `flows` verb output; it does not describe
`flows`' implementation.

## 1. Top-level object

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "generated_at": "<ISO 8601 UTC>",
  "repo": "<owner/name>",
  "decision_queue": [ ... ],
  "flows": [ ... ],
  "sessions": [ ... ],
  "ledger": [ ... ],
  "hygiene": { ... }
}
```

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | integer | see §4 |
| `generated_at` | string | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp of payload generation |
| `repo` | string | `owner/name` of the target board repo |
| `decision_queue` | array | see §2.1 |
| `flows` | array | see §2.2 |
| `sessions` | array | see §2.3 |
| `ledger` | array | see §2.4 |
| `hygiene` | object | see §2.5 |

## 2. Section schemas

### 2.1 `decision_queue[]`

One entry per open PR awaiting phase 1 or phase 2 approval.

```json
{
  "issue": 172,
  "pr": 201,
  "phase": 1,
  "role": "implementation",
  "opened_at": "2026-07-30T09:12:00Z",
  "age_hours": 26.3,
  "awaiting": "approve-scope"
}
```

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `issue` | integer | subject issue number |
| `pr` | integer | PR number |
| `phase` | integer | `1` or `2` |
| `role` | string | role name (e.g. `implementation`) |
| `opened_at` | string | ISO 8601 UTC |
| `age_hours` | number | hours since `opened_at` |
| `awaiting` | string | `"approve-scope"` (phase 1) or `"approve-full"` (phase 2) |

### 2.2 `flows[]`

One entry per subject.

```json
{
  "issue": 172,
  "stage": "implementing",
  "stage_derived": true,
  "roles": [
    { "role": "implementation", "loop_state": "scope-approved", "verdict": "progressed" }
  ],
  "prs": [201],
  "plan": [
    { "step": 1, "roles": ["implementation"], "done": true },
    { "step": 2, "roles": ["execution-observation", "conformance-review"], "done": false }
  ]
}
```

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `issue` | integer | subject issue number |
| `stage` | string | one of `"proposal"`, `"approved"`, `"implementing"`, `"delivered"`, `"closed"`, OR the raw `loop_state` string when unmapped (see below) |
| `stage_derived` | boolean | `true` when `stage` was mapped from a rulebook-defined `loop_state`→stage rule; `false` when no mapping exists and `stage` holds the raw `loop_state` string verbatim |
| `roles` | array of `{role, loop_state, verdict}` | per-role status within the subject |
| `prs` | array of integers | PR numbers associated with the subject |
| `plan` | `array<{step: int, roles: [string], done: bool}>` \| `null` | parsed from the subject issue body's `## 실행 계획` block. Step lines have the form `- [ ] step <N> <role>[ ‖ <role2> ...]`; `‖` splits parallel roles (same step number) into the `roles` array. Content inside code fences is ignored when parsing; header variants like `## 실행 계획 (...)` also match. `null` means no `## 실행 계획` block is present; `[]` means the header is present but no valid step line was found — these are distinct values, never interchangeable. A plan-only subject (an open issue with a `## 실행 계획` block but no other board activity yet) still gets a `flows[]` entry as soon as the issue is created. |

When a subject's `loop_state` has no rulebook-defined mapping to one of
the five named stages, `flows[].stage` is **not** forced into the
nearest bucket — it is set to the raw `loop_state` string and
`stage_derived` is `false`. Consumers must treat `stage_derived: false`
as "this value is not one of the five enum members" and handle it
distinctly (e.g. render as unknown/raw rather than mapping to a fixed
color/label).

### 2.3 `sessions[]`

One entry per active roster row.

```json
{
  "role": "implementation",
  "issue": 172,
  "elapsed_min": 14.2,
  "pid": 48213,
  "alive": true,
  "verdict": "pending",
  "last_activity": { "ts": "2026-07-31T12:03:44Z", "kind": "tool_use",
                     "detail": "Write roles/data-modeling.json" }
}
```

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `role` | string | role name |
| `issue` | integer | subject issue number |
| `elapsed_min` | number | minutes elapsed since session start |
| `pid` | integer | process id |
| `alive` | boolean | whether the process is currently running |
| `verdict` | string | `"pending"` when `alive: true`; otherwise looked up from the newest matching ledger entry for this role/issue |
| `last_activity` | object \| `null` | see below; `null` when the roster entry has no `log` path, the log file is missing, or its tail could not be parsed |

`last_activity` is derived from the tail of the session's `.session.log` (the
raw `stream-json` transcript) — parsing happens only inside `flows`
(contract provider side); consumers still read only this JSON field, never
the log itself.

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ts` | string | ISO 8601 UTC — the log file's mtime, not a record timestamp (the CLI transcript carries none) |
| `kind` | string | `"tool_use"`, `"text"`, or `"result"` — the type of the last meaningful transcript record found in the tail |
| `detail` | string | human-readable one-liner, truncated to 80 chars: tool name + its most salient input (e.g. `"Write roles/data-modeling.json"`, `"pytest test_spawn.py 실행"`) for `tool_use`; first non-empty line of the message for `text`; the result/subtype string for `result` |

Only the last 64KiB of the log is read (tail-based, not a full scan) and any
read/decode/parse failure yields `last_activity: null` rather than an
error.

### 2.4 `ledger[]`

Aggregated **per issue** (not a raw per-session dump).

```json
{
  "issue": 172,
  "sessions": 3,
  "cost_usd_total": 4.87,
  "outcomes": { "progressed": 2, "refused": 1 }
}
```

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `issue` | integer | subject issue number, derived from each raw ledger entry's `board_delta` path (`docs/issue-<n>/...`) |
| `sessions` | integer | count of raw ledger entries attributed to this issue |
| `cost_usd_total` | number | summed cost across attributed sessions |
| `outcomes` | object | map of outcome label → count, keys open-ended (e.g. `progressed`, `refused`, ...) |

Sessions whose raw ledger entry has no derivable issue (empty
`board_delta`) are **not** dropped and **not** guessed onto an issue.
They are aggregated into a separate `unattributed` bucket, documented
alongside `ledger[]` (not one of its per-issue entries):

```json
"unattributed": { "sessions": 1, "cost_usd_total": 0.42 }
```

`unattributed` sits at the same nesting level as `ledger` (an
adjacent top-level-ish field next to the `ledger` array), not inside
any `ledger[]` entry. See the worked example in §6 for exact
placement.

### 2.5 `hygiene`

Single object, not an array.

```json
{
  "closure_sweep": [ /* find_violations() output structure, reused verbatim */ ],
  "unapproved_open_prs": [
    { "issue": 172, "pr": 201, "role": "implementation", "opened_at": "2026-07-30T09:12:00Z" }
  ]
}
```

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `closure_sweep` | array | verbatim output of `gates.closure_sweep.find_violations()` — structure owned by that module, passed through unchanged |
| `unapproved_open_prs` | array of `{issue, pr, role, opened_at}` | open PRs past phase 1 (`loop_state` already `scope-approved` or later) with neither a matching `APPROVE issue-<n>/<role>` comment from an approvers.md account nor a PR review Approve from a different approvers.md account |

## 3. Versioning policy

- `schema_version` is a **bare integer**, not semver. There is exactly
  one consumer (repo-status-board), so minor/patch granularity is not
  needed.
- Bump `schema_version` **only** on a breaking change: a field is
  removed, a field is renamed, or a field's type changes.
- Additive changes — a new field appended to an existing object, a new
  optional key, a new section — **never** bump `schema_version`.

Examples:

| change | breaking? | version bump? |
|---|---|---|
| add `pr_url` field to `decision_queue[]` entries | no | no |
| rename `flows[].stage` to `flows[].status` | yes | yes |
| change `ledger[].cost_usd_total` from number to string | yes | yes |
| add a new top-level `notes` array | no | no |
| remove `sessions[].pid` | yes | yes |
| add a new outcome key to `ledger[].outcomes` | no | no |

## 4. GitHub API call-count contract

This is a **load-bearing contract**, not incidental detail — the
dashboard consuming `flows --json` polls this command repeatedly, so
the call count must stay flat as the number of roles grows and linear
(not quadratic) as the number of subjects grows.

For one board repo with `S` open subjects, `R` roles per subject, and
`P` open PRs, a full `flows --json` run makes:

- **1** call — `gh repo view` (cached)
- **1** call — `gh pr list --state all --json number,headRefName,createdAt,state,body,reviews --limit <cap>`, repo-wide; this single call's results are matched locally (by parsing `headRefName` against `issue-<n>/<role>`) to cover `decision_queue`, `flows[].prs`, and the PR-review side of `hygiene.unapproved_open_prs`
- **up to `S`** calls — `gh issue view`, one per subject
- **up to `S`** calls — `gh api .../comments`, one per subject, for phase-1/2 comment-approval detection

Total: **linear in `S`, flat in `R`** (independent of both `R` and
`P`). The naive per-branch approach this replaces was `O(S×R)`.

## 5. Data provenance: `sessions[]` and `ledger[]` are local-orchestrator data

`sessions[]` and `ledger[]` are sourced from `spawn.py`'s **own**
`runs/` directory (`runs/active.json` and `runs/ledger.jsonl`) — local
state of the orchestrator checkout that ran the sessions. They are
**not** derived from the target board repo passed via `-C`.

A consumer reading only the board repo (its issues, PRs, and
`docs/issue-<n>/...` files) cannot reconstruct `sessions[]` or
`ledger[]` — that data only exists in the orchestrator's local `runs/`
directory and is not written back to the board repo. Any dashboard or
downstream tool relying on these two sections must talk to the same
orchestrator checkout that ran the sessions being reported.

## 6. Non-goals

- **Read-only.** `flows --json` never mutates the board repo and never
  posts comments, matching `status()`'s documented invariant.
- **No exit-code-as-alert semantics.** Hygiene violations are data in
  the payload (`hygiene.closure_sweep`, `hygiene.unapproved_open_prs`),
  not a non-zero exit code. Non-zero exit is reserved for hard failures
  (not-a-board, `gh` auth failure). This is a separate concern from
  `closure-sweep`'s own `--post`/exit-1 behavior, which stays a
  distinct verb.
- **No dashboard polling-cadence guidance.** How often a consumer polls
  this command is the consumer's concern, not part of this schema.

## 7. Worked example
